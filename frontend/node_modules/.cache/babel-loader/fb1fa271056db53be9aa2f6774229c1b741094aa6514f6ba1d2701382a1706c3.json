The hotels, pickups, tour sights , guides & other arrangements \r\n        made by Mercury team were superb & very well executed. We were lucky to see the Northern Lights 3 times - \r\n        thanks to cloud breaks. The Snowdrome & sledge ride was a grand experience.  </p>\r\n\r\n      <div className=\"d-flex align-items-center gap-4 mt-3\" >\r\n        <img src={ava03} className='w-25 h-25 rounded-2' alt=\"\" />\r\n        <div>\r\n          <h6 className='mb-0 mt-3'>Kevin Shiren</h6>\r\n          <p>Customer</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"testimonial py-4 px-3\">\r\n      <p>  I take this pleasure to thank Mercury Travels for a wonderful & unforgettable trip to London. \r\n        Thanks for all the love and care you had expressed to each of us specially \"My Birthday celebration\"\r\n        :- I was impressed at the every moment that we had interacted with your team before and during the trip.  </p>\r\n\r\n      <div className=\"d-flex align-items-center gap-4 mt-3\" >\r\n        <img src={ava02} className='w-25 h-25 rounded-2' alt=\"\" />\r\n        <div>\r\n          <h6 className='mb-0 mt-3'>Vinitha Grace</h6>\r\n          <p>Customer</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </Slider>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Testimonials"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAK,MAAM,OAAO;AACzB,OAAOC,MAAM,MAAM,aAAa;AAChC,OAAOC,KAAK,MAAM,+BAA+B;AACjD,OAAOC,KAAK,MAAM,+BAA+B;AACjD,OAAOC,KAAK,MAAM,+BAA+B;AAAC;AAElD,MAAMC,YAAY,GAAG,MAAM;EAGzB,MAAMC,QAAQ,GAAG;IACfC,IAAI,EAAE,IAAI;IACVC,QAAQ,EAAE,IAAI;IACdC,QAAQ,EAAE,IAAI;IACdC,KAAK,EAAE,IAAI;IACXC,YAAY,EAAE,IAAI;IAClBC,aAAa,EAAE,IAAI;IACnBC,YAAY,EAAE,CAAC;IAEfC,UAAU,EAAE,CACV;MACEC,UAAU,EAAE,GAAG;MACfT,QAAQ,EAAE;QACRO,YAAY,EAAE,CAAC;QACfG,cAAc,EAAE,CAAC;QACjBC,QAAQ,EAAE,IAAI;QACdV,IAAI,EAAE;MACR;IACF,CAAC,EACD;MACEQ,UAAU,EAAE,GAAG;MACfT,QAAQ,EAAE;QACRO,YAAY,EAAE,CAAC;QACfG,cAAc,EAAE;MAElB;IACF,CAAC;EAEL,CAAC;EAED,oBAAQ,QAAC,MAAM;IAAA,GAAKV,QAAQ;IAAA,wBAC1B;MAAK,SAAS,EAAC,uBAAuB;MAAA,wBACpC;QAAA,UAAG;MAIwB;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAI,eAE/B;QAAK,SAAS,EAAC,sCAAsC;QAAA,wBACnD;UAAK,GAAG,EAAEJ,KAAM;UAAC,SAAS,EAAC,qBAAqB;UAAC,GAAG,EAAC;QAAE;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAG,eAC1D;UAAA,wBACE;YAAI,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;YAAA,UAAC;UAAmB;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAK,eAClD;YAAA,UAAG;UAAQ;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAI;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QACX;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QACF;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QACF,eACN;MAAK,SAAS,EAAC,uBAAuB;MAAA,wBACpC;QAAA,UAAG;MAEyG;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAI,eAEhH;QAAK,SAAS,EAAC,sCAAsC;QAAA,wBACnD;UAAK,GAAG,EAAEC,KAAM;UAAC,SAAS,EAAC,qBAAqB;UAAC,GAAG,EAAC;QAAE;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAG,eAC1D;UAAA,wBACE;YAAI,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;YAAA,UAAC;UAAa;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAK,eAC5C;YAAA,UAAG;UAAQ;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAI;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QACX;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QACF;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QACF,eACN;MAAK,SAAS,EAAC,uBAAuB;MAAA,wBACpC;QAAA,UAAG;MAG4E;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAI,eAEnF;QAAK,SAAS,EAAC,sCAAsC;QAAA,wBACnD;UAAK,GAAG,EAAEC,KAAM;UAAC,SAAS,EAAC,qBAAqB;UAAC,GAAG,EAAC;QAAE;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAG,eAC1D;UAAA,wBACE;YAAI,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;YAAA,UAAC;UAAY;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAK,eAC3C;YAAA,UAAG;UAAQ;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAI;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QACX;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QACF;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QACF,eACN;MAAK,SAAS,EAAC,uBAAuB;MAAA,wBACpC;QAAA,UAAG;MAIwB;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAI,eAE/B;QAAK,SAAS,EAAC,sCAAsC;QAAA,wBACnD;UAAK,GAAG,EAAEF,KAAM;UAAC,SAAS,EAAC,qBAAqB;UAAC,GAAG,EAAC;QAAE;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAG,eAC1D;UAAA,wBACE;YAAI,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;YAAA,UAAC;UAAmB;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAK,eAClD;YAAA,UAAG;UAAQ;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAI;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QACX;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QACF;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QACF,eACN;MAAK,SAAS,EAAC,uBAAuB;MAAA,wBACpC;QAAA,UAAG;MAG4E;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAI,eAEnF;QAAK,SAAS,EAAC,sCAAsC;QAAA,wBACnD;UAAK,GAAG,EAAEE,KAAM;UAAC,SAAS,EAAC,qBAAqB;UAAC,GAAG,EAAC;QAAE;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAG,eAC1D;UAAA,wBACE;YAAI,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;YAAA,UAAC;UAAY;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAK,eAC3C;YAAA,UAAG;UAAQ;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAI;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QACX;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QACF;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QACA,eACN;MAAK,SAAS,EAAC,uBAAuB;MAAA,wBACtC;QAAA,UAAG;MAEyG;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAAI,eAEhH;QAAK,SAAS,EAAC,sCAAsC;QAAA,wBACnD;UAAK,GAAG,EAAED,KAAM;UAAC,SAAS,EAAC,qBAAqB;UAAC,GAAG,EAAC;QAAE;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAG,eAC1D;UAAA,wBACE;YAAI,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;YAAA,UAAC;UAAa;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAK,eAC5C;YAAA,UAAG;UAAQ;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAAI;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QACX;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QACF;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QACF;EAAA;IAAA;IAAA;IAAA;EAAA,QACC;AAEX,CAAC;AAAA,KAxHKE,YAAY;AA0HlB,eAAeA,YAAY;AAAA;AAAA"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
